Thank you for creating a pull request to contribute to Adafruit's GitHub code! Before you open the request please review the following guidelines and tips to help it be more easily integrated:
.PP
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fBDescribe the scope of your change--i\&.e\&. what the change does and what parts of the code were modified\&.\fP This will help us understand any risks of integrating the code\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fBDescribe any known limitations with your change\&.\fP For example if the change doesn't apply to a supported platform of the library please mention it\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fBPlease run any tests or examples that can exercise your modified code\&.\fP We strive to not break users of the code and running tests/examples helps with this process\&.

Thank you again for contributing! We will try to test and integrate the change as soon as we can, but be aware we have many GitHub repositories to manage and can't immediately respond to every request\&. There is no need to bump or check in on a pull request (it will clutter the discussion of the request)\&.
.PP
Also don't be worried if the request is closed or not integrated--sometimes the priorities of Adafruit's GitHub code (education, ease of use) might not match the priorities of the pull request\&. Don't fret, the open source community thrives on forks and GitHub makes it easy to keep your changes in a forked repo\&.

After reviewing the guidelines above you can delete this text from the pull request\&.
