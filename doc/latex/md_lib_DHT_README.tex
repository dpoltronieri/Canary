To download. click the D\+O\+W\+N\+L\+O\+A\+DS button in the top right corner, rename the uncompressed folder \hyperlink{class_d_h_t}{D\+HT}. Check that the \hyperlink{class_d_h_t}{D\+HT} folder contains D\+H\+T.\+cpp and D\+H\+T.\+h. Place the \hyperlink{class_d_h_t}{D\+HT} library folder your $<$arduinosketchfolder$>$/libraries/ folder. You may need to create the libraries subfolder if its your first library. Restart the I\+DE.
